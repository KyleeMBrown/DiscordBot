# JarvisBot -> [Demo Here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1353878573861179402&permissions=1689934340028480&integration_type=0&scope=bot)
## Brief Summary:
I created this Discord bot to be able to look up Marvel Rivals characters and view their stats. I also integrated Google AI in order to give
the users the ability to ask any question to the JarvisBot, much like the actual Jarvis in Marvel
<br></br>
## Libraries Used:
- [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
- Google Genai
<br></br>
## Hosting
### Amazon Web Services EC2:
- UBUNTU Operating System
- `t2.micro` Instance type
- I used `tmux` to run my bot in the background

## Future Additions & Features:
- Integrate Jarvis AI memory with Discord chat memory for a more seamless conversation experience
- Allow players to check their own live stats of other games (not just Marvel Rivals)
- Ability for users to administer polls to the server by typing a command to JarvisBot
